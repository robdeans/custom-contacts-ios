CustomContacts
============

Welcome to the Custom Contacts repo! (Naming improvement pending)

The objectives of this application are two-fold:
1. Provide a user interface similar to the native Contacts app, with the additional feature that Contacts can be tagged, categorized, and filtered into Groups
2. Explore various experimental toolkits, frameworks, and design patterns!

Originally only intended to research iOS-17, the current `iOS-17` branch has essentially become the defacto branch.

Concepts currently being explored are:
- TCA
- Dependency Injection (including PointFree Dependencies)
- Swift Data
- In-app navigation and deep-link routing
- Private Apple APIs (which can access "unavailable" Contact data such as `last_updated`)
